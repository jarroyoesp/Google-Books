# TDD Weather App
This is an example of Android application using TDD and MVVM design pattern to show the current weather and forecast. I created this project for a few reasons:

1. To experiment with MVVM
2. To experiment with the Android Architecture Components
3. To experiment with stable Kotlin coroutines
4. To use as a starting point in future projects where clean architecture feels appropriate

It is written 100% in Kotlin with both UI and Unit tests
